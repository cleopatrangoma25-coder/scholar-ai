- ✅ Proper API request/response handling
- ✅ Academic-focused prompts with citation formatting

### 2. **Complete RAG Pipeline**
- ✅ Query embedding generation
- ✅ Vector search (simulated, ready for Vertex AI Vector Search API)
- ✅ Context preparation from search results
- ✅ Gemini-powered answer generation
- ✅ Source formatting and citation

### 3. **Document Ingestion**
- ✅ Real embedding generation for document chunks
- ✅ Document preparation for Vertex AI Search
- ✅ Upload pipeline (ready for Vertex AI Search API)

## 🔧 Setup Instructions for Testing

### Option 1: Quick Setup with Google Cloud SDK

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK**
   ```bash
   # Download from: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
   # Or use the installer in your project: GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe
   ```

2. **Authenticate and Set Project**
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project scholar-ai-1-prod
   ```

3. **Test the RAG Implementation**
   ```bash
   node test-rag.js
   ```

### Option 2: Service Account Setup (Recommended for Production)

1. **Run the Setup Script**
   ```bash
   .\scripts\setup-gcp.ps1 -ProjectId scholar-ai-1-prod
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   set GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=scholar-ai-1-prod
   set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./gcp-service-account-key.json
   ```

3. **Test the RAG Implementation**
   ```bash
   node test-rag-with-auth.js
   ```

### Option 3: Manual Service Account Creation

1. **Create Service Account in Google Cloud Console**
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
   - Create new service account: `scholar-ai-sa`
   - Grant roles: `AI Platform Developer`, `Storage Object Viewer`

2. **Download Service Account Key**
   - Create and download JSON key file
   - Save as `gcp-service-account-key.json`

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   set GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=scholar-ai-1-prod
   set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./gcp-service-account-key.json
   ```

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### Test Scripts Available:

1. **`test-rag.js`** - Basic test (requires gcloud auth)
2. **`test-rag-with-auth.js`** - Enhanced test with auth validation
